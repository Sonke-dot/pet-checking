    <p>
      Pet Sanctuary began with a simple mission — rescue, heal, and protect the animals 
      that needed us most. From a humble foster home to a full sanctuary, our work continues 
      to grow thanks to our volunteers, supporters, and the pets who inspire us every day.

  <h2>Our History</h2>
  <p>
    Pet Sanctuary was founded in 2013 as a small rescue program dedicated to giving abandoned 
    and neglected animals a second chance. Over time, our passion grew into a full sanctuary 
    providing shelter, medical care, rehabilitation, and adoption services for hundreds of pets 
    each year.
